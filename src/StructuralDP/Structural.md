1. By extending our project,to implement at least 3 structural design patterns;

2. Keep the files grouped (into packages/directories);

3. Document the work in a separate markdown file;

                                                                           Theory :
In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.Structural class patterns use inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes/abstractions, but the structural object patterns use composition which is generally a more flexible alternative to inheritance.
 
Some examples of from this category of design patterns are :

1)Adapter-Allows the conversion of the interface of a class to another interface that clients expect. This allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.

2)Bridge-	Allows the separation of an abstract interface from its implementation. This eliminates the dependency between the two, allowing them to be modified independently.

3)Composite-Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object.

4)Decorator-Extends the functionality of an object in a manner that is transparent to its clients without using inheritance.

5)Facade-	Provides a higher-level interface to a subsystem of classes, making the subsystem easier to use.

6)Flyweight-Flyweight pattern is primarily used to reduce the number of objects created and to decrease memory footprint and increase performance.

7_Proxy-	Allows a separate object to be used as a substitute to provide controlled access to an object that is not accessible by normal means.
